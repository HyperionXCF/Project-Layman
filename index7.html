        step-1 : always change directory from home (default in powershell) to the folder which you want to use git in.
        cmd = cd ~/Desktop/foldernamehere

        step-2 : see if the directory is changed to the folder which you want to use by using ls (list items cmd)
        cmd = ls

        step-3 : create the first version initialise git (sets up git inside the chosen folder)
        cmd = git init  

        step-4 : check status - shows all the past activities done in that particular folder.
        cmd = git status

        step-5 : git will also tell us whether there are new files in that 
        chosen folder which are not added / committed to git.
        
        <img src="images/image6-git2.png">

        step-6 : git add . 
        here dot represents the current folder which you are in. 

        therefore it will add the whole folder to git.

        step-7 : checking the status again using 
        cmd = git status 

        output : 
        <img src="images/git4.png">

        git add filenames lets us pick which files we want next in this specific version
        
        step-8 : to create the first version (log) 
        cmd = git commit -m "type your message here..."
        version = commit 
        -m lets us attach a message with the commit 

        step-9 : git log cmd 
        git log commands shows us all the commits (version) which have been 
        uploaded / commited up till now. for example I am making new additions to the website every now and then,
        therefore I have commited 3 times. (made 3 versions)

    <h2>therefore basic workflow of the git is  <br>
        1. get into the folder which you want to work with <br>
        2. add files from that folder to git <br>
        3. commit them with a message <br>
        4. done <br>
        5. repeat the same again and again each time you need to add files and <br>
        commit them again and again... <br>

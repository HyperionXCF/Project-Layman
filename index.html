            <h1>LYRICS TO J.Cole's A M A R I</h1>
            Bada-ba, bada-ba, bada-ba, da-da
            Off-Season
            Let's work, hey
            Plottin' my escape, this game ridin'-ridin' faith
            Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe

            Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
            I was doin' 80 on the interstate
            Tryna make it back before my class started
            
            Country n- never seen a passport
            'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
            Now I'm at the Gardens sittin' half court
            
            Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
            'Ville n- never seen nothin'
            'Cept a triple-triple bean jumpin'
            Good-good leave a fiend crumpin'
            
            Made it out, it gotta mean somethin'
            Either you gon' hustle hard
            A n- Uncle Sam got your a- re-enlisting
            Two-six, murder scene pumpin'
            
            Better leave it tucked, 'cause y'ain't dumpin'
            Pow, pow, n-, he slumpy
            12 comin', we ain't seen nothin'
            
            Time change, n- ain't rumblin' no more
            Nah, what for? Hungry for more
            If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumblin'
            Bow-tie and I'm still munchin'
            
            Big bag, never fear fumblin'
            Want smoke? N- don't choke
            I'm a whole nico-nicotine company
            Dreamville the only, not a Navy
            How could you ever try to play me?
            
            Kill 'em on a song walk up out the booth
            Do the Westbrook rock-a-baby
            I never fall out with the bro
            Hate when your family turn into foe
            We had a penthouse on the road
            
            Interior decorated with the h-
            Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
            My n- like "Eenie, meenie, minee, moe"
            Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
            
            Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
            Out of the concrete was a rose and windows was cold
            Had to go over and stand by the stove
            We from the Southeast, n- know
            This where the opps creep real slow
            
            Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
            I punch the time sheet, not no more
            And now my assigned seat is a throne
            Plottin' my escape, this game ridin'-ridin' faith
            Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
            Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
            I was doin' 80 on the interstate
            
            Tryna make it back before my class started
            Country n- never seen a passport
            'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
            Now I'm at the Gardens sittin' half court
            
            Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
            'Ville n- never seen nothin'
            'Cept a triple-triple bean jumpin'
            Good-good leave a fiend crumpin'
            
            Made it out, it gotta mean somethin'
            Made it out, it gotta mean somethin'
            Made it out, it gotta mean somethin'
            Bada-ba, bada-ba, bada-ba, ah-ah

    <h1>In this section I am going to apply <br>and learn how to use hyperlinks in HTML</h1>
    <p> we use a for anchor tag for hyperlinks in HTML, in a tag we use href hyper text reference, <br> put a link to website here </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw"
    target = "_blank"
    title ="This link will open the video which am using to learn HTML and css ">
         click me
     </a>
     <pre>
        1. I used href ="" - hyper text reference - put the link here
        2. target ="_blank" - allows to open the href link into new tab 
        3. title =" " - this tag will give a pop up with some reference to what the click me blue text does.
